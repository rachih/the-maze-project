# The Maze Game

A simple console-based maze game written in C where the player navigates through a maze using the `WASD` keys. The goal is to move the player through the maze and explore the paths, avoiding the walls.

## Features

- Simple 2D maze grid.
- Player movement using `WASD` keys:
  - `W` - Move up.
  - `A` - Move left.
  - `S` - Move down.
  - `D` - Move right.
  - `Q` - Quit the game.
- Smooth player movement with visual updates on the terminal.
- Color-coded maze representation using ANSI escape codes.

## Requirements

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC) for compiling the code.
- Windows OS (for compatibility with `conio.h` and `windows.h` libraries).
- Alternatively, you can adapt it for Linux/macOS with slight modifications for terminal input/output handling.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
